title: Statistical Estimation of Histogram Variation for Texture Classification (2005)
author: Robert E. Broadhurst

1. Introduction

In his article, Broadhurst presents a parametric approach to estimate the likelihood of homogeneously textured images. His work extends the framework proposed by Levina (PhD thesis, 2002) by using a Gaussian Bayes classifier instead of a 1-NN classifier. To model each texture class, he uses multivariate Gaussian distributions to model the intra-class variability of each marginal histogram. This is done by mapping the joint marginal histograms into Euclidean space and applying PCA [to obtain the eigenvalues and expected projection error for each class].
Marginal distributions of each filter response are estimated by using non-parametric histograms. There are several advantages to this:
	1.This approach eliminates effectively the need to use a texton dictionary as proposed by Varma & Zisserman (2004). The use of such dictionary would limit the generalization of a texture class and also needs clustering in high-dimensional spaces.
	2. Marginal distributions can be estimated accurately, while joint distributions often suffer from the curse of dimensionality
Although less descriptive than joint conditional distributions, the dependencies among filter responses are captured by estimating the joint intra-class variation of the marginals. This approach increases the descriptive power of the marginal distributions while still maintaining the computational efficiency. The method is applied to the MR8 filter bank (described in Varma & Zisserman).
