In this chapter, some fundamental properties of local illumination models will be outlined. Although these fundaments are 

\section{BRDF}
The bi-directional reflectance distribution function, first described by {\it Nicodemus et al} \cite{Nicodemus}, can be used as a tool for describing the scattering of light from a surface. This function is assumed to be a local illumination model, meaning that incoming light will be reflected at the point of intersection with the surface \footnote{The BRDF is an approximation of the BSSRDF (Bi-directional scattering surface reflectance distribution function). The BSSRDF simulates the phenomenon of subsurface scattering; light enters the material and after scattering leaves the material at a point different from the intersection point of the incoming light beam.}
